# CheckRSS

## What CheckRSS does

CheckRSS loads an RSS file and checks if there are new items since the last time it was checked. It is intended to be used with cron jobs.

## How CheckRSS works

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Eius culpa a similique, ducimus dignissimos tempore, cumque dolor quisquam doloremque possimus numquam. Consequuntur ab, voluptatem architecto dolores voluptatum perspiciatis. Sint, quasi.

**NOTE: If you happen to arrive to this repo, please have in mind that CheckRSS is in very early development stages and it doesn't work currently. It's here because I'm using this repository for learning git/Composer/Packagist.**
