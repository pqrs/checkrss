# CheckRSS

## What CheckRSS does

CheckRSS loads an RSS file and checks if there are new items since the last time it was checked. It is intended to be used with cron jobs.

It only checks the last (newest) item. If there are two or more new items between program runs you'll only get the last one, losing the others. The publication periodicity depends of the source so it's up to you running the program as often as necessary.


## How CheckRSS works

CheckRSS provides two functions: getLastItem() and isNewItem().

**object getLastitem( string $feed_url )**

Given a feed URL as its only parameter, this functions loads the feed and returns its last (newest) item.

An example of the item returned would be:

```SimpleXMLElement Object
(
    [guid] => https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-irma/...
    [title] => One-two punch of disease and Irma has left Florida citrus reeling
    [pubDate] => Sat, 10 Feb 2018 15:17:00 GMT
    [link] => https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/hurricane-irma/...
    [description] => Hurricane Irma served as a knockout punch for many of Florida's...
)
```

**boolean isNewItem( string $itemId )**

Finds wether an item's Id is new (returns true) or not (false).

It stores the last item Id in a file (lastrss.txt) to compare with in new checks. Directory must have write permissions (666) if you call it through your web browser.

**NOTE: If you happen to arrive to this repo, please have in mind that CheckRSS is in early development stages**
